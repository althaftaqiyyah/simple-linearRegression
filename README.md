# Simple Linear Regression Model for Predicting Advertising Cost Based on Sales

## Overview
This model is a simple linear regression model developed to predict advertising costs based on the number of sales. The model is built using 36 data points, each consisting of sales and corresponding advertising costs.

## Model Summary
- **Model Type:** Simple Linear Regression
- **Dependent Variable (Y):** Advertising Cost
- **Independent Variable (X):** Sales
- **Number of Data Points:** 36
- **Coefficient of Determination (R²):** 0.3978668208721431
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 14.367119905549034

## Interpretation

### Predictions
The model's predictions for advertising costs based on different sales figures are as follows:
- For 50 sales, the predicted advertising cost is 77.82756831 units.
- For 100 sales, the predicted advertising cost is 173.5759746 units.
- For 150 sales, the predicted advertising cost is 269.3243809 units.

## Evaluation
The model shows a positive relationship between sales and advertising costs. However, with an R² value less than 0.5, the model does not fully capture the complexity of the relationship. While the model provides a general trend, the moderate explanatory power and prediction errors suggest that other factors may influence advertising costs.

## Usage
This model can be used for:
- Gaining a preliminary understanding of the relationship between sales and advertising costs.
- Making rough estimates of advertising costs based on sales figures.
- Identifying the need for more complex models or additional variables to improve prediction accuracy.

## Recommendations
- **Data Collection:** Collect more data points to improve the robustness of the model.

## Conclusion
This simple linear regression model provides a basic understanding of how sales can influence advertising costs. However, for more accurate and reliable predictions, it is recommended to enhance the model by incorporating additional data and exploring more sophisticated modeling approaches.
